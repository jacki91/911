Strategy for Collecting UGC Content in Variety Shows
Set the Theme for the Collection

Set specific themes based on the program's positioning and requirements, guiding viewers to create content around the theme. For example, if the program is a variety show about food, themes like "Creative Gourmet Cooking" can be set, which will make the collected UGC content more in line with the program's needs and targeted.

Multi-form Collection

Accept a variety of content forms such as videos, text, images, etc. Different audiences have different strengths in creative expression, and a multi-form call for submissions can attract more types of audience participation. For example, travel-themed variety shows can collect photos from the audience's travels, travelogues, or homemade travel short videos.

Incentive Mechanism

Provide appropriate rewards such as merchandise from the show, opportunities to interact with guests, or credit within the program. This can increase viewer engagement and motivate them to create high-quality content. For example, the show could promise to display the names of outstanding UGC creators at the end of each episode or offer signed photos and other prizes.

KOL Guiding

Invite KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) in relevant fields to participate and guide UGC content collection activities. With their influence and fan base, KOLs can motivate fans to create and engage in the show's UGC content collection. For example, beauty gag programs invite beauty KOLs to initiate makeup challenges, encouraging fans to share their own makeup photos and experiences.

Regular Collection

Set a fixed period for the call for submissions, such as once a month or every quarter. This will create anticipation among the audience and also help the show to continuously obtain fresh UGC content. For example, a music variety show can launch a lyrics creation call for submissions once a month.

Platform Display and Promotion

Feature high-quality UGC content on the official platforms of the show (such as the official website, social media accounts, etc.). This not only recognizes the creators but also attracts more audience participation and enriches the content of the show. For example, showcasing on the show's Weibo account, beautiful images or interesting videos created by the audience related to the program.
